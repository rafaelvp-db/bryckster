    "Pandas is a Python library in Python that allows for you to easily work with tabular data that is often stored in Excel files or .csv files. It is often considered one of the most vital Python libraries for data analysis because of its ease of use. There are other Python libraries that allow you to work with Excel data, such as XLSX and XLRD, which are leveraged by Pandas on the back end to interact with Excel spreadsheets. However, most tabular data is stored in .csv files, or Comma Separated Values files. There are other variations of this same structure (such as .tsv), but they all work the same. They use a special character to denote movement in the table to the next cell.\n",

    "If you work with data at all or plan to in the future, becoming comfortable with Pandas early on will make your life a lot easier. There are other Python libraries that allow you to work with .csv files, such as CSV, but these are not the same as Pandas. Pandas has one large advantage over CSV. It not only allows you to input .csv files into Python, it allows you to easily load them as DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DataFrames** are special data structures that contain not only the raw data in a table, but preserve the structure and hierarchy of that table. By loading .csv files as a DataFrame, Pandas not only allows you easy access to your data, but a powerful way to analyze it within a script. In addition to that, Pandas also has robust built-in features that we will explore throughout this textbook.\n",

(We can grab all rows that have a certain value in a certain column also, but we will see that a bit later.) To grab a row by index, you can use the iloc command. This stands for Index Location. Index Location can be indexed rather like a list, as in the code below. The index you choose should correspond to the row index (starting with 0)."
